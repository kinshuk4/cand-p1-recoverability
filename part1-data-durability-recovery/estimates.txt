Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) for this Multi-AZ, multi-region database:

1. Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage is 3 minutes.
Reason: It takes 1-2 minutes to start up a new RDS instance. Adding 1 minute as a buffer.

2. Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage is 0 minutes.
Reason: We already have secondary instance, so, data loss is minimised due to failover.

3. Minimum RTO for a single region outage is 30 minutes.
Reason: This includes time for following:
a) Availability of site reliability engineer
b) Promote read replica to master
c) Change application configuration to point to new DB instance

4. Minimum RPO for a single region outage is 5 minutes
Reason: It depends on how frequent the database backup is. In case of 5 minutes interval, it also results in high cost.
